This is just about the simplest example, or HelloWorld, application you can
build with FlickrApp.

FlickrApp itself has a variety of other helper methods but this is the short and
sweet example to get you started.

This example application will do nothing more than check to see if you're signed
in and offer to log you in if you're not and log you out if you are.

You will need:

* A valid Flickr API key, registered as a web application. Both the API key and
  the application secret will need to be added to the config.py file.

  If you don't have a Flickr API key, you can get one here:

  http://www.flickr.com/services/api/keys/apply/

* A valid GAE account and a recent version of the GAE SDK for Python (>= 1.2.3)
  which can be downloaded from:
